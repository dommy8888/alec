        Thou art more lovely and more temperate:  
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,  
        And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.  
        Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,  
        And often is his gold complexion dimmed;  
        And every fair from fair sometime declines,  
        By chance or nature’s changing course untrimmed;  
        But thy eternal summer shall not fade  
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;  
        Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade,  
        When in eternal lines to time thou growest:  
        So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,  
        So long lives my love, and this gives life to thee.</p>

        I love thee to the level of every day’s  
        Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.  
        I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;  
        I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.  
        I love thee with a passion put to use  
        In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.  
        I love thee with a love I seemed to lose  
        With my lost saints, I love thee with the breath,  
        Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose,  
        I shall but love thee better after death.</p>

        We will love each other till the end of time,

        I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.  
        I love thee with the passion put to use  
        In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.  
        I love thee with a love I seemed to lose  
        With my lost saints, I love thee with the breath,  
        Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose,  
        I shall but love thee better after death.</p>

        <h2 class="title">She Walks in Beauty</h2>
        <p class="text">She walks in beauty, like the night  
        Of cloudless climes and starry skies;  
        And all that's best of dark and bright  
        Meet in her aspect and her eyes:  
        Thus mellowed to that tender light  
        Which heaven to gaudy day denies.  
        One shade the more, one ray the less,  
        Had half impaired the nameless grace  
        Which waves in every raven tress,  
        Or softly lightens o'er her face;  
        Where thoughts serenely sweet express,  
        How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.  
        And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,  
        So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,  
        The smiles that win, the tints that glow,  
        But tell of days in goodness spent,  
        A mind at peace with all below,  
        A heart whose love is innocent!</p>

        <h2 class="title">When You Are Old</h2>
        <p class="text">When you are old and grey and full of sleep,  
        And nodding by the fire, take down this book,  
        And slowly read, and dream of the soft look  
        Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;  
        How many loved your moments of glad grace,  
        And loved your beauty with love false or true,  
        But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,  
        And loved the sorrows of your changing face;  
        And bending down beside the glowing bars,  
        Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled  
        And paced upon the mountains overhead  
        And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.</p>

        <h2 class="title">The Raven</h2>
        <p class="text">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,  
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—  
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,  
        As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.  
        "'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door—  
        Only this and nothing more."  
        Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;  
        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.  
        From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—  
        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—  
        Nameless here for evermore.</p>

        <p class="text">I carry your heart with me (I carry it in my heart)  
        I am never without it (anywhere I go you go, my dear; and whatever is done by only me is your doing, my darling)  
        I fear no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet)  
        I want no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true)  
        And it's you are whatever a moon has always meant  
        And whatever a sun will always sing is you</p>

        <p class="text">O my Luve's like a red, red rose  
        That's newly sprung in June:  
        O my Luve's like the melodie  
        That's sweetly played in tune.  
        
        As fair art thou, my bonnie lass,  
        So deep in luve am I;  
        And I will love thee still, my dear,  
        Till a' the seas gang dry.  
        
        Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear,  
        And the rocks melt wi' the sun:  
        I will love thee still, my dear,  
        While the sands o' life shall run.</p>

        <h2 class="title">To My Dear and Loving Husband</h2>
        <p class="text">If ever two were one, then surely we.  
        If ever man were loved by wife, then thee;  
        If ever wife was happy in a man,  
        Compare with me, ye women, if you can.  
        I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,  
        Or all the riches that the East doth hold.  
        My love is such that Rivers cannot quench,  
        Nor ought but love from thee give recompence.  
        Thy love is such I can no way repay,  
        The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.  
        Then while we live, in love let’s so persevere  
        That when we live no more, we may live ever.</p>

      Love remains unbroken, constant as the stars.</p>
